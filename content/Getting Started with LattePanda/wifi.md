2.In Windows select a Wi-Fi connection by clicking the Wi-Fi icon in the system tray at the bottom right of the screen. Follow the wizard to setup a connection. 

**Note**: A weak Wi-Fi signal may prevent a Wi-Fi connection being established. Check the antenna is connected properly to the board and make sure that a Wi-Fi network is available.
