# Drivers and Software

## Regular Drivers

We use Intel Driver & Support Assistant (Intel DSA) to install and update Delta drivers.

Intel DSA can auto-detect the relevant drivers or updates for you according to your CPU model, which is very simple and convenient. Let's start together!



1) First, download the [Intel Driver & Support Assistant](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html) Application on Intel website.



2) Run Intel DSA, and it will start to auto-detect drivers and updates for you. (please use the Google Chrome browser to open, other browsers may cause Intel DSA detection error)

3) Follow the on-screen prompts to download and install the drivers or updates.



!!! note
    Some users have reported that the driver of PCI Data Acquisition and Signal Processing Controller is still missing after installing all drivers according to the guide. We suggest you can try to install some third party software to fix this issue, such as [Driver Booster 7](https://www.iobit.com/en/driver-booster.php).



## Touch Panel Drivers

The touch panel driver for Delta is same as that for LattePanda V1.0. 

[Windows 10 Drivers (V1.1) - 32Bit](https://github.com/LattePandaTeam/LattePanda-Win10-Software/raw/master/Drivers/2G32GB_Drivers/Touch/32%20bit%20GoodixTouchDriver%20v1.1.rar)

[Windows 10 Drivers (V1.1) - 64Bit](https://github.com/LattePandaTeam/LattePanda-Win10-Software/raw/master/Drivers/4G64GB_Drivers/Touch/64%20bit%20GoodixTouchDriver%20v1.1.rar)



PLEASE NOTE: 

“install.bat” must be run as an administrator to update the driver correctly.
