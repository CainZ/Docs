# Get Started

This document will review starting your LattePanda for the first time. It will go over what you need to boot up as well as instructions for getting started.

## What You Will Need to Boot Alpha
To get started, you will need the following hardware:

* Supplied USB Type C wall adapter or other power supply (Please see the Powering LattePanda Alpha section for a list of methods to power your LattePanda)
* Display cable (HDMI, eDP display)
* Display (TV, monitor, or eDP display)
* Input devices (Keyboard, mouse, etc.)
* Boot Drive (Optional)

!!! note
    If your device is the **LattePanda Alpha 800**, which comes without eMMC storage onboard, you will need a boot drive with an operating system installed on it. See the Operating Systems page for different acceptable media for booting the operating system of your choice and installation instructions.

## Step 1: Connect Wi-Fi & Bluetooth

Install the Wi-Fi antenna by plugging the round shaped end into the socket. (<u>**The antenna is in the box**</u>) 

Note: The Delta board only needs one antenna.
