# Power on device

First of all, let me show you how to boot your LattePanda as a normal PC!

## Step 1: Connect Wi-Fi & Bluetooth

Install the Wi-Fi antenna by plugging the round shaped end into the socket. (<u>**The antenna is in the box**</u>) 

Note: The Delta board only needs one antenna.

## Step 2: Connect a Screen

The most common display interface is HDMI, which is why there is one on the LattePanda

## Step 3: Connect Adapter & Power on

In our box, we provide the power supply adapter. Plug in the Type C cable from the power supply adapter and wait few seconds until the Blue LED light off. Then hold the power button for 3 seconds to power on the device.
