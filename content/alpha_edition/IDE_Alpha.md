# Common Desktop IDE

**For software developers,** we listed some common IDEs below, so you can build your desktop development environment easily! 

If you are interested in **IoT** to **control the physical world** and **get sensor data**, the built in Arduino makes it easy and friendly with support for **different types of programming langauages.**

Enjoy coding!
