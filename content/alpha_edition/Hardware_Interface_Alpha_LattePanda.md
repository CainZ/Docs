## M Key
The M key interface allows PCI-E X4 or SATA storage.
### **Storage**
* M.2 NVMe SSD
* SATA III SSD

### M.2 To PCI-E Adapter

A PCI-E adapter can be versatile, allowing you to add hardware typically dedicated for full size motherboards to a single board computer form factor. This includes cards such as desktop graphic cards.\
**Note: When using a PCI-E adapter only 4 lanes are usable.**
### External GPU
There are several videos on Youtube where desktop graphic cards are used on the LattePanda. An example video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKchBNFBeTE).

## E Key

The E key interface allows PCI-E X2, USB 2.0, I2C, or UART.

# USB 3.0 Interface

This is the most common interface. All three are USB 3.0 which allows transfering data up to 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s), 10 times faster than the USB 2.0 standard! Due to the large bandwith, LattePanda can connect more accessories such as RealSense camera and virtual reality headsets.

# USB-C Interface

There is a USB-C interface on the board, formally known as **USB Type-C**. It can be used as a 12V power Input or use a USB-C hub to expend more interface like DP, DVI, SD card socket, etc.

## USB C Hub

A USB Type C hub can be used with the LattePanda Alpha. This can expand the number of ports you can use off just one connector. This can include SD/MicroSD, ethernet, USB, HDMI, ethernet, and many other ports.

## RS232

The RS-232 standard had been commonly used in computer serial ports. Thanks to their simplicity and past ubiquity,it is also used in industrial machines, networking equipment, and scientific instruments where a short-range, point-to-point, low-speed wired data connection is required.
