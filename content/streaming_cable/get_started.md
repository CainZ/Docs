# Streaming Cable

Run your LattePanda as a ‘virtual machine’ on any computer but faster, easier and more stable to operate. The Streaming Cable is the first virtual network cable to **support RNDIS and 5G bandwidth**, much faster than a gigabyte NIC and compatible with any Remote control protocol like NX, RDP, and VNC. Please follow the instruction below to set up your first physical ‘virtual machine’.



## Quick Start

### Hardware Requirement

You will need to prepare the following devices before use

1. **Host**: A **LattePanda** or other computer that needs to be connected and controlled, running Windows or MacOS

2. **Client:** A computer, runs Windows, MacOS or Ubuntu, **such as your MacBook**

3. A streaming Cable

   ​

### Recommended Software Solutions

Please **choose the same one for your Host and Client** according to the Host's OS and your needs. This tutorial contains installation guides for Microsoft Remote Desktop and NoMachine. You can setup other software solutions accordingly.

- **Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDP):** Support for Hosts with Windows 10 Pro or above OS (such as LattePanda Alpha or Delta), you can use Microsoft's standard RDP protocol for quickly configuration, seamless copy and paste, and get a full virtual machine experience


- **NoMachine:** Supports all Windows, MacOS or Ubuntu, NoMachine will unleash the performance potential of the streaming cable. You can **coding, watch videos or even play games** in your Client just like you would on a local device
- **Steam:** To get the best gaming experience on your client, we recommend using [Steam In-Home Streaming](https://store.steampowered.com/streaming/), 1080P HD, low latency, allow offline mode, support for all Windows and Mac OS
